Transcript
00:00:00 Speaker 1
Keep warm and they say, yeah, OK. OK, maybe we could start now. Thank you for your time. And again to meet you again after your placement. Yeah, we will today. I think we will discuss about our. It's a kind of I think it's a freelance.
00:00:20 Speaker 1
Project because actually I have an I have another business that.
00:00:28 Speaker 1
Is.
00:00:29 Speaker 1
I could share my website but it's kind of.
00:00:36 Speaker 1
Consultancy business. So that's why I use this account. Email address is separate from archive. Studio is Archive studio is a marketing agency firm and this firm is my other business users.
00:00:52 Speaker 1
I will use this business to to have certain kind of virtual consultancy for the for the client, so I will I will test you my existing account, so PY limited. Yeah. So you can have a look.
00:01:11 Speaker 1
About my existing website, but it's too rough and too too simple, so that's why we would like to have a project also. Meanwhile, Lavinia has his cousin.
00:01:23 Speaker 1
Also want to have upgrade their websites so so we are thinking about if you could helping us for this freelance project. Maybe we could have a chat about this yeah.
00:01:38 Speaker 1
OK, I think maybe I I could. I could send my existing email existing.
00:01:49 Speaker 1
Ohh.
00:01:51 Speaker 1
Website.
00:01:53 Speaker 1
For you to have a look. Yeah, because I think it's it's because it's was done by myself. But so I think it's not that.
00:02:02 Speaker 1
Good.
00:02:03 Speaker 1
So think about your guys, maybe you could have.
00:02:10 Speaker 2
Hey.
00:02:11 Speaker 1
More professional on this kind of service, so there.
00:02:15 Speaker 1
That's why we could have a helping me to upgrade the our content and also we need to have a check box in order to to have the checkbox capabilities that only certain prompts you will connect to a human version to online using.
00:02:34 Speaker 1
Microsoft team service so OK, I test you OK, I test you.
00:02:45 Speaker 1
I sent through the chat meeting room.
00:02:48
And your people?
00:02:49 Speaker 1
And you could you could, yeah.
00:02:51
OK.
00:03:03 Speaker 1
The.
00:03:09
Yes.
00:03:12 Speaker 2
So you're sending it through the chat room? Yeah.
00:03:16 Speaker 2
OK. Yeah, right. So I suppose, yeah.
00:03:20 Speaker 1
OK.
00:03:22 Speaker 2
This is only new newly set up. Well, we've been looking at challenges, been looking at a lot of the arcade studio stuff. So this one has been done, but he set that one up about 20/20/22, I think several years ago we haven't had any chance to actually do anything about that one.
00:03:42 Speaker 2
At this point, because things are changing, he's been trying to work out what to do.
00:03:48 Speaker 2
Two, et cetera. And because the whole landscape have changed quite a bit. So that's why we he hasn't actually done anything towards that at this point. Now with all both of your profile obviously are very good at programming, doing all of the pieces.
00:04:08 Speaker 2
In there. But to expand your opportunity in IT ICT and also what do you can potentially get yourself into getting freelance work and or work?
00:04:21 Speaker 2
This type of things would probably enhance your your your CV as well. OK, just to make sure that you also have the capability to go in there, look at assisting problem, not just doing implementation all the.
00:04:35 Speaker 2
Time.
00:04:36 Speaker 2
Yeah. OK. Because it really depends on what you can put your well put your foot.
00:04:41 Speaker 2
I mean at the door for any organisation, what they have at this point sometimes depends on the job market also because and yourself at the moment it's only a student on student visas, I believe.
00:04:56 Speaker 3
Yeah.
00:04:57 Speaker 2
Yeah. So making contacts and being able to do fairness job is also a good opportunity for you to actually build up your experience profile.
00:05:10 Speaker 2
You will not. OK, so.
00:05:19 Speaker 2
One of the things that you guys are really good at, we we've coming up with the solution and the latest and the greatest, you know, all the most topic at the moment is obviously Chabot and AI. So I thought this is a real issue that he's having.
00:05:37 Speaker 2
And it is actually quite common between.
00:05:42 Speaker 2
Child's organisation as well as else Asia as well, where they also want to start changing their business into the latest landscape of what people and business actually wants. OK, and having the capability.
00:06:02 Speaker 2
Of answering some very simple questions and or having questionnaires online to actually gather the information from the users best and then go and determine whether you can actually.
00:06:17 Speaker 2
Use the training AI technology or to give the simple answer and then lead them into wanting a consultation in online with a consultant.
00:06:37 Speaker 2
So think about that one. That's what's actually what people want to do is this one is I have an issue.
00:06:43 Speaker 2
I have something I want to look at. I want maybe marketing help, maybe corporate service help, maybe project management help you potentially can actually go in as an assistant AI assistant and or taper assistant ask a few questions, give them very simple area or answer and then any further.
00:07:04 Speaker 2
Information that you were directed to a.
00:07:08 Speaker 2
A check box from and set up the checkbox would go to a human being.
00:07:12 Speaker 2
That's the that's the initial.
00:07:15 Speaker 2
Thinking of what we can do. OK, so I think this one is what I would like you guys to have a think of at this point is.
00:07:26 Speaker 2
What are the possibility what can be done?
00:07:30 Speaker 2
OK so.
00:07:33 Speaker 2
And what could you come up with?
00:07:40 Speaker 2
It's actually quite interesting area. So you have you can use all the technology and all the things that you you learn out there that you have and you put them you know into practise with something that well we just have this we would like to.
00:07:59 Speaker 2
We would like to improve it. What can you provide? So looking at you as a consultant now. OK, use your technology background and come up with a solution.
00:08:13 Speaker 2
OK, come up with a suggestion.
00:08:16 Speaker 3
OK so.
00:08:17 Speaker 2
Yeah, there is one. Yeah, sorry.
00:08:20 Speaker 3
You go. So you're thinking about like an AI powered chatbot and.
00:08:28 Speaker 3
Sorry, I don't. I'm not. I don't know the details about marketing things. So do you expect some kind of questions that users?
00:08:41 Speaker 3
Ask.
00:08:44 Speaker 2
Yep. One of the example that we can give you is there is a question there that you can actually out go for as a.
00:08:54 Speaker 2
To start off with and that's what we're gonna give you to start off, to play with what? Actually going to be. So don't worry about the in depth one because once you've got it working for a few of the questions and get the idea going, the real thing that we want behind is easier to change. OK, so make up questions.
00:09:07 Speaker 3
OK.
00:09:13 Speaker 2
To actually start that start off with and.
00:09:18 Speaker 2
Yeah, we're gonna get you a few of them. That is not the the real, you know, question there that they need to field in and and do assessment etcetera. But we're gonna just get you guys to try the idea out.
00:09:32 Speaker 2
OK, so it's very simple things that you can just ask a few questions, get simple ideas, get maybe you know, train that the the chat, but enough to actually have a few.
00:09:46 Speaker 2
Links that I supply for the user to go. For example, you know here are some of the more detailed training courses that you can go into if you want to learn more information. But if you want to talk to someone to actually get more training in person, contact us and you know make it make, make a booking for for a meeting.
00:10:06 Speaker 2
OK. Something along that line right, very simple.
00:10:10 Speaker 3
OK.
00:10:11 Speaker 3
And.
00:10:11 Speaker 2
But the first thing is to actually get the technology going because it is within. I think Charles's website is built on the on wix.com. OK, so we don't know what Wix actually have in terms of plugin or.
00:10:31 Speaker 2
Are you guys able to do coding with it or not as the case may be? Or should it be redirected to a completely standalone chat bot that you guys built?
00:10:44 Speaker 3
OK so.
00:10:46 Speaker 2
We don't know at this point, so that's why it is a more investigation, less come to do, you know, help us out to actually see what can be done and also at the same time you guys actually got some learning out of that as well.
00:11:07 Speaker 2
Of the project.
00:11:09 Speaker 3
So it's made with wix.com and are you planning to use wix.com?
00:11:21 Speaker 2
This this website is already built on mix.com, so at this stage we are not planning to.
00:11:26 Speaker 2
Move.
00:11:27 Speaker 3
OK.
00:11:28 Speaker 2
Weeks.com, unless there are some really good reason why that you actually have to move right? So this is basically is as a consultant.
00:11:39 Speaker 2
Going in there, the organisation have really already had a certain technology being used. You have to basically work with.
00:11:47 Speaker 2
Then what within its constraint and boundaries, so not always have to be able to actually get the best solution. That yeah, they need to go change things because money is going to be issued, licencing is gonna be issued, etcetera. So how can we make the the most out of the existing environment?
00:12:06 Speaker 3
Then I think we should research about.
00:12:10 Speaker 3
What kind of your features we provide? Yeah.
00:12:10 Speaker 2
Yeah, that's why we started with this meeting.
00:12:13 Speaker 2
Yeah. So Charles will start to give you guys a collaborator account for the website behind this, OK. So you can you guys can go in and have a look around change and do a few things. And then if you don't, if you want to recreate a.
00:12:33 Speaker 2
A different site that's not published, obviously within weeks, does allow you to have to do a lot of drafting there and just show concept then please do that. There's no issue with that if the collaborator admin is.
00:12:49 Speaker 2
Has hasn't got enough privileges in there. Just let us know. Then we'll change around one of my my account as admin, co-owner to one of you guys to have a look. OK. Now because that one is in a way, if I one person's job, the next one that we want to look at is that.
00:13:09 Speaker 2
What if we want to actually? Well, actually not. What if else asia.com is actually a site with WordPress.
00:13:19 Speaker 2
It is not Wacom, it's actually using WordPress, so if you guys could want to have a look at the details on Wix and then one looking at you know what's the difference between moving it to WordPress or having WordPress doing that?
00:13:36 Speaker 2
OK, so let's just I think this this very small one as an initial investigation.
00:13:44 Speaker 2
To have a look and then we can come back to think about and talk about all the design without going into details on, you know what exactly we're gonna do. So this is just going to be a collaborative, you know, team work and say, OK, I found these, this is what essentially there this is what we can do. This is what we can do.
00:14:03 Speaker 2
And basically interpret the technical details as to to a business, become a a business analyst in that sense to explain it to Charles, to say, OK, now you need to make a decision of which way you want to go.
00:14:21
OK.
00:14:23 Speaker 2
I think I probably have talked to you guys before. You can be a very good technical person, right? And do all the coding, but nowadays to be an all rounder, you actually need to be a good business analyst.
00:14:37 Speaker 2
Right now, some people, some company can't afford having a business.
00:14:42 Speaker 2
List because you gotta pay them. And so as a technical person, right, sometimes they actually want a, you know, a combined person. We can do both because the organisation they are not. I have a lot of time, strong so small nowadays. So for you guys to be able to look at business issue.
00:15:02 Speaker 2
And then also provide a technical solution at the same time being able to code it and implement it.
00:15:11 Speaker 2
Is actually one of your advantage.
00:15:17 Speaker 2
OK.
00:15:27 Speaker 2
So.
00:15:28 Speaker 2
Say that again, Daniel, which one? Just actually said something?
00:15:33 Speaker 2
I just heard something.
00:15:35 Speaker 1
Yes. I just think if they have any questions.
00:15:38 Speaker 1
So far, Richard, so far. Can you?
00:15:39 Speaker 2
Any.
00:15:44 Speaker 2
Don't know anything.
00:15:46 Speaker 4
I might just ask.
00:15:50 Speaker 4
How long would we be expected to?
00:15:53 Speaker 1
Complete this by.
00:15:58 Speaker 2
This is going to be a mini project at this point in time. I know that you guys are busy, so I'm hoping that if you don't mind within your your turn break that actually you have the the stretch of your turn break to actually you know get to.
00:16:15 Speaker 2
A solution hopefully, but we're going to still meet as as frequent as you need so that we can actually keep it moving. So if we need to actually just have a quick question, quick meeting every couple of days and or you know whichever way that you.
00:16:33 Speaker 2
You were like then or after you've done some research and say, hey, you know, we've got this far, we need some some decision. Can we meet up and talk for, you know, half an hour and then before we.
00:16:45 Speaker 2
Do any further than that.
00:16:47 Speaker 2
Correct. We just basically do it that way, OK, because we don't want to kill your holiday completely. Alright? It is a break, but we appreciate your you know, you guys are willing to actually come in and join the this team to have a look at some existing issue.
00:17:07 Speaker 2
That we're trying to get our head around, we can't even write it up at this point as a project for work integrated learning session for the next of the students. So I suppose in our in our on the other hand, you guys are helping us to shape the next project 4th of 12 weeks project.
00:17:28 Speaker 2
Yeah. So as much as you guys can do and can contribute will be really appreciated. Unfortunately, as you know the the.
00:17:39 Speaker 2
Charles has probably talked about that this is something I talked about last time. This is not a pay internship. It is also a, you know, an unpaid one. But what's in return is that, you know, we will be accessible to you to within the next, you know, 6 to 12 months. That's if you need any career.
00:17:59 Speaker 2
Coaching or any areas that we are experiencing that you can you can.
00:18:04 Speaker 2
This, you know, reach out for us to actually help. For example, you know, having a look you you look look like you have a job that you would like to apply. You've got a cover letter, you've got your CV that is not completely general by AI but you want to actually have someone else as a human being to actually have a look around and saying, you know what that dish.
00:18:24 Speaker 2
You know is there. Can we do a mock interview? We can do that.
00:18:27 Speaker 2
For you.
00:18:29 Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah.
00:18:31 Speaker 2
OK, so a more a career coaching and any other area that we can discuss with both of you together and or separately that we can see that the skills that you might like to improve or have under your belt or training courses, you might want to actually go do.
00:18:53 Speaker 2
To get yourself up to speed and or have the advantage to other candidates out there applying for jobs.
00:19:03
Yeah.
00:19:04 Speaker 2
So let there be project management, practise configuration management, practise, data management practise etcetera. So we have a whole heap.
00:19:12 Speaker 2
Of things that.
00:19:14 Speaker 2
Under our belt that we can potentially give that one to you guys and you know cope you guys through it.
00:19:26 Speaker 4
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that sounds good.
00:19:30 Speaker 2
Yeah. So basically what we're offering is a mentoring service that is outside of the of the unit.
00:19:39 Speaker 4
Alright. Yeah, no, that sounds good. Thank you.
00:19:43 Speaker 2
OK, so basically just make up make make a make a you know, whatever question that you have, even if there's just anything that's, you know, a a question that you're not sure how to approach it. Just yeah. Send us an email and you know.
00:19:59 Speaker 2
Or our team calls and then we'll arrange a time and just have a chat with, you know, other individually. Obviously, you know, both of you have different needs.
00:20:09 Speaker 2
OK.
00:20:11 Speaker 4
Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for that.
00:20:17 Speaker 4
In the.
00:20:21 Speaker 2
OK, I know there's a lot to.
00:20:26 Speaker 2
Digest at this point in terms of what's actually there, what chat bot? What's what's the AI? How do you integrate open AI? How do you train something? What technology to be used wix.com? What is it? How do you actually do something about it? And and WordPress you might not. On your CV you do.
00:20:45 Speaker 2
You do not have it listed, so I assume that you don't have as much.
00:20:52 Speaker 2
Experience with those. So my suggestion is probably for today. Have a think about. Have a look around what this one is. Go and do some research and then maybe we'll come back, you know, Thursday or Friday for the quick meeting and just say OK.
00:21:12 Speaker 2
You know, we know a bit more now. We understood what you trying to do, but we this type of information decision, we need more info before we can proceed.
00:21:26 Speaker 2
Would that work well for you guys?
00:21:32 Speaker 3
Yeah, all good.
00:21:34 Speaker 2
Well, good. OK, that's great. So have a look around what have a play around are are some of the other tools on chatbot go to ChatGPT and co-pilot or whatever that you can get your hands on on implementation of chatbot, the flow of it and you know what can be done, what can be done?
00:21:54 Speaker 2
What they suggest, I mean, we always, I have a few ideas of what needs to be done. We have another team that was working.
00:22:02 Speaker 2
On a final chat bot next, but we still yet to to provide more information. The last one didn't work out very well, so from.
00:22:14 Speaker 2
From our perspective, we'll start giving you some of the potential questions mini scenario that we would would like to see for you to test, OK within the next 48 hours or so to give that to you. So you can actually have a purpose on researching.
00:22:34 Speaker 2
More info and.
00:22:37 Speaker 2
Yeah. So then the next discussion would be ohk. OK, now we know what we need to do. This is the steps those other information will potentially need go around, go in, locked in, see whether you can log into thewix.com that shells provided one of you can probably look at how to enhance this.
00:22:57 Speaker 2
Particular site to make it a little.
00:22:59 Speaker 2
Bit more, yeah.
00:23:03 Speaker 2
In lighting.
00:23:06 Speaker 2
And come up with suggestion as well in there and think about how we can actually integrate the chatbot in there whether wix.com have plugin or is there somewhere that have a HTML block or whatever block that they have that you can use to trigger that.
00:23:25 Speaker 2
OK. Or why do you have to do a completely full development? There's a few questions that I don't even know the answer. I haven't even looked into it yet.
00:23:34 Speaker 2
But we'll just go into look into that a bit more once you guys had a go at it and let us know what you found and then we can talk about those.
00:23:51 Speaker 2
Potentially, as you know once.
00:23:55 Speaker 2
You.
00:23:57 Speaker 2
Of helping trail to configure this child would have to actually configure some of the stuff himself, so if he actually go have to go in and add extra questions.
00:24:06 Speaker 2
It's that easy. Sydney too. You know, he has got no coding background whatsoever, so that's why we actually started to actually he uses weeks at the moment. So he managed to actually get this one through and put all the information in there, which is pretty amazing. I think he did a great job for what he could do so.
00:24:25 Speaker 2
So some of the bits and pieces in terms of getting the.
00:24:31 Speaker 2
The menu items on the page and about us and etc. Getting the right standard.
00:24:38 Speaker 2
Web page look and feel. It's not quite there yet. OK, so you guys also imagine look at.
00:24:43 Speaker 2
One of you can actually say, oh, you know, I'll do the technology part. You know, you might want to actually have a look at how to play around with the.
00:24:51 Speaker 2
With the current website as well.
00:24:53 Speaker 2
See how you go.
00:24:55 Speaker 2
OK.
00:24:58 Speaker 2
So Helen, if that's OK, can I let you? And then you'll talk between you 2 and see which part that you to prefer to be concentrating bit more.
00:25:11 Speaker 2
Aunt, who would like to look at the more technology part or both of you gonna look technology Part 1 of you is going to look at the the website or you guys come up with a a website standard.
00:25:23
What?
00:25:24 Speaker 2
What seems to be a standard website besides a good design for this particular 1 to merge into or theme that you think that would work for him for for him and Charles? And then yeah, and it suggested.
00:25:42 Speaker 3
Alright, OK, we'll talk about it.
00:25:47 Speaker 2
Yeah, sounds good. OK. So always think about, you know, all the online manual and you have a look at all the, you know, professional consulting website out there. What's missing in this particular one, which is a few things. So yeah.
00:26:04 Speaker 2
Have to play around in their do a draught.
00:26:08 Speaker 2
Post copies existing one and then you know create a new page and then move them around and do a show and tell.
00:26:18 Speaker 2
There's also a good way for you guys to get familiar.
00:26:20 Speaker 2
With mixed.com as well.
00:26:25 Speaker 2
OK.
00:26:28 Speaker 2
Can we have a chat again on Friday sometime?
00:26:33 Speaker 2
Or one day next week if you want.
00:26:43 Speaker 2
Which one's better for you guys?
00:26:50 Speaker 1
Friday or something. Or maybe you could discuss.
00:26:55 Speaker 2
Yeah. OK. And come back to us. Yeah, come back to us and see what what you would like to to see and look at your timing and your social calendar. It's OK if it's Monday as well. It doesn't have.
